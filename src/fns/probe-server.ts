// --- cgroup v2 CPU-throttle reader (diagnostic only) ------------------------
// Lambda (Amazon Linux 2023) caps a function's CPU with a cgroup v2 quota
// proportional to memory (1.8GB ≈ 1 vCPU, so 512MB ≈ 0.28 vCPU). When a round's
// concurrent fan-out exhausts that quota within a scheduling period, the kernel
// PARKS the whole process until the next period — 10–40ms stalls that
// performance.now() elapsed absorbs, inflating near-cell latency. cpu.stat's
// nr_throttled / throttled_usec count exactly those parks. Reading it before and
// after the pool turns the current INFERENCE ("event-loop delay looks high, so
// it's probably CPU throttling") into DIRECT evidence: seconds of throttled_usec
// per round confirms the quota is the cause; near-zero refutes it. cpu.max gives
// the quota/period so the numbers are interpretable. All reads are best-effort:
// --- CPU-starvation diagnostic (diagnostic only) ----------------------------
// The near-cell-inflation hypothesis is that the 512MB Lambda's CPU quota
// (~0.28 vCPU) is exhausted during the concurrent fan-out, so the kernel parks
// the whole process for 10–40ms and performance.now() elapsed absorbs the wait.
// The obvious source, cgroup v2 cpu.stat (nr_throttled/throttled_usec), is NOT
// available: the Lambda microVM does not mount /sys/fs/cgroup at all (ENOENT),
// verified empirically. So we measure the effect two dependency-free ways that
// DO work in the sandbox:
//
// 1. process.cpuUsage(): CPU microseconds (user+system) actually consumed. The
//    ratio cpuMs/wallMs over the pool phase is the effective CPU utilization.
//    If the process is compute-starved against a ~0.28 vCPU cap, the ratio
//    presses toward that ceiling while wall time stretches; a low ratio means
//    the round is I/O-bound and CPU isn't the bottleneck.
// 2. A periodic SPIN PROBE: run a fixed, known amount of pure synchronous work
//    and measure its wall time. If a spin whose CPU cost is ~1ms sometimes takes
//    20–40ms of wall time, the process was descheduled mid-spin — direct,
//    unambiguous evidence of CPU parking that a per-fetch timer can't attribute.
//    We record the worst inflation factor (wall/cpu) seen across the round.

// Calibrated busy-work: a fixed iteration count whose synchronous cost is a few
// ms on this class of vCPU. Measured as wall vs cpu so parking shows up as
// wall >> cpu. Kept small (runs a handful of times per round) so it adds
// negligible GB-seconds and never competes meaningfully with real probes.
function spinOnce(iterations: number): { wallMs: number; cpuMs: number } {

// to an origin. We count those per-hostname so a probe sample can tell whether
// it reused a warm socket or paid a fresh TCP+TLS handshake. This is the signal
// that decides between the two live hypotheses for AWS self-cell bimodal
// latency: if the slow samples opened new connections, the ~15ms slow-mode
// offset is handshake cost; if they reused a socket, it's CPU/scheduling delay
// on the small Lambda vCPU (performance.now() elapsed absorbing a parked
// process). Subscribing is cheap and adds no probe requests. It's wrapped in a
