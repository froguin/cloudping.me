// Daily probe-health census: reads the public 7-day history and flags target
// cells that are collecting far fewer samples than their peers — i.e. the probe
// reaches most targets fine but a subset is intermittently missing.
//
// WHY: a full census (this session) found that a data/config mistake — pointing
// Linode object-storage probes at the bucket-list root '/' — silently dropped
// samples for 22 cells while everything else looked fine. That kind of regression
// doesn't fail CI and isn't visible without aggregating the history. This runs
// daily and, when a cohort of cells is unhealthy, opens (or refreshes) ONE
// tracking issue for a human to diagnose. It never edits data or config.
//
// DATA SOURCE: the public status branch history.json (no AWS creds needed).
// It stores only SUCCESSFUL samples per cell keyed origin\tprovider\tregion; a
// healthy cell accrues ~48 samples over the 7-day window (one per 30-min round).
//
// METHOD: per origin, the typical (modal) sample count is the "expected" number
// for that origin's window. A cell is "starved" if it has < STARVED_FRACTION of
// that typical count. We then group starved cells by provider and by whole
// endpoint host, because a real regression shows up as a COHORT (many cells of
// one provider/host), not one-off noise. Single scattered starved cells (normal
// transient loss) are reported as a count but don't, by themselves, open an issue.
//
// OUTPUT: --json prints a machine summary the workflow uses to decide whether to
// open an issue (hasProblem = any provider/host cohort above the alert threshold).
// Exit 0 always unless the history fetch/parse fails (then non-zero so the
// workflow surfaces real breakage).
